# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the sumcpp branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ sumcpp ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ sumcpp ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
     Ubuntu:
        name: Generate results on the latest Ubuntu release
