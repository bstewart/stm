\title{Exclusivity}
\usage{
exclusivity(model, M = 10, frexw = 0.7)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{the STM object}

\item{M}{the number of top words to consider per topic}

\item{frexw}{the frex weight}
}
\value{
a numeric vector containing exclusivity for each topic
}
\description{
Calculate an exclusivity metric for an STM model.
}
\details{
In Roberts et al 2014 we proposed using the Mimno et al 2011 \code{\link{semanticCoherence}} metric 
for helping with topic model selection. We found that semantic coherence alone is relatively easy to
achieve by having only a couple of topics which all are dominated by the most common words.  Thus we
also proposed an exclusivity measure.  

Our exclusivity measure includes some information on word frequency as well.  It is based on the FREX
labeling metric (\code{\link{calcfrex}}) with the weight set to .7 in favor of exclusivity by default.
 
 This function is currently marked with the keyword internal because it does not have much error checking.
