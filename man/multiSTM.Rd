\usage{
multiSTM(
  mod.out = NULL,
  ref.model = NULL,
  align.global = FALSE,
  mass.threshold = 1,
  reg.formula = NULL,
  metadata = NULL,
  reg.nsims = 100,
  reg.parameter.index = 2,
  verbose = TRUE,
  from.disk = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod.out}{The output of a \code{selectModel()} run. This is a list of
model outputs the user has to choose from, which all take the same form as
the output from a STM model. Currently only works with models without
content covariates.}

\item{ref.model}{An integer referencing the element of the list in
\code{mod.out} which contains the desired reference model.  When set to the
default value of \code{NULL} this chooses the model with the largest value
of the approximate variational bound.}

\item{align.global}{A boolean parameter specifying how to align the topics
of two different STM fitted models. The alignment is performed by solving
the linear sum assignment problem using the Hungarian algorithm. If
\code{align.global} is set to \code{TRUE}, the Hungarian algorithm is run
globally on the topic-word matrices of the two models that are being
compared. The rows of the matrices are aligned such as to minimize the sum
of their inner products. This results in each topic in the current runout
being matched to a unique topic in the reference model. If
\code{align.global} is, conversely, set to \code{FALSE}, the alignment
problem is solved locally. Each topic in the current runout is matched to
the one topic in the reference models that yields minimum inner product.
This means that multiple topics in the current runout can be matched to a
single topic in the reference model, and does not guarantee that all the
topics in the reference model will be matched.}

\item{mass.threshold}{A parameter specifying the portion of the probability
mass of topics to be used for model analysis. The tail of the probability
mass is disregarded accordingly. If \code{mass.threshold} is different from
1, both the full-mass and partial-mass analyses are carried out.}

\item{reg.formula}{A formula for estimating a regression for each model in
the ensemble, where the documents are the units, the outcome is the
proportion of each document about a topic in an STM model, and the
covariates are the document-level metadata. The formula should have an
integer or a vector of numbers on the left-hand side, and an equation with
covariates on the right-hand side. If the left-hand side is left blank, the
regression is performed on all topics in the model. The formula is
exclusively used for building calls to \code{estimateEffect()}, so see the
documentation for \code{estimateEffect()} for greater detail about the
regression procedure. If \code{reg.formula} is null, the covariate effect
stability analysis routines are not performed. The regressions incorporate
uncertainty by using an approximation to the average covariance matrix
formed using the global parameters.}

\item{metadata}{A dataframe where the predictor variables in
\code{reg.formula} can be found. It is necessary to include this argument if
\code{reg.formula} is specified.}

\item{reg.nsims}{The number of simulated draws from the variational
posterior for each call of \code{estimateEffect()}. Defaults to 100.}

\item{reg.parameter.index}{If \code{reg.formula} is specified, the function
analyzes the stability across runs of the regression coefficient for one
particular predictor variable. This argument specifies which predictor
variable is to be analyzed. A value of 1 corresponds to the intercept, a
value of 2 correspond to the first predictor variable in \code{reg.formula},
and so on. Support for multiple concurrent covariate effect stability
analyses is forthcoming.}

\item{verbose}{If set to \code{TRUE}, the function will report progress.}

\item{from.disk}{If set to \code{TRUE}, \code{multiSTM()} will load the
input models from disk rather than from RAM. This option is particularly
useful for dealing with large numbers of models, and is intended to be used
in conjunction with the \code{to.disk} option of \code{selectModel()}.
\code{multiSTM()} inspects the current directory for RData files.}
}
\value{
An object of 'MultimodDiagnostic' S3 class, consisting of a list
with the following components: \item{N}{The number of fitted models in the
list of model outputs that was supplied to the function for the purpose of
stability analysis.} \item{K}{The number of topics in the models.}
\item{glob.max}{The index of the reference model in the list of model
outputs (\code{mod.out}) that was supplied to the function. The reference
model is selected as the one with the maximum bound value at convergence.}
\item{lb}{A list of the maximum bound value at convergence for each of the
fitted models in the list of model outputs. The list has length N.}
\item{lmat}{A K-by-N matrix reporting the L1-distance of each topic from the
corresponding one in the reference model. This is defined as:
\deqn{L_{1}=\sum_{v}|\beta_{k,v}^{ref}-\beta_{k,v}^{cand}|} Where the beta
matrices are the topic-word matrices for the reference and the candidate
model.} \item{tmat}{A K-by-N matrix reporting the number of "top documents"
shared by the reference model and the candidate model. The "top documents"
for a given topic are defined as the 10 documents in the reference corpus
with highest topical frequency.} \item{wmat}{A K-by-N matrix reporting the
number of "top words" shared by the reference model and the candidate model.
The "top words" for a given topic are defined as the 10 highest-frequency
words.} \item{lmod}{A vector of length N consisting of the row sums of the
\code{lmat} matrix.} \item{tmod}{A vector of length N consisting of the row
sums of the \code{tmat} matrix.} \item{wmod}{A vector of length N consisting
of the row sums of the \code{wmat} matrix.} \item{semcoh}{Semantic coherence
values for each topic within each model in the list of model outputs.}
\item{L1mat}{A K-by-N matrix reporting the limited-mass L1-distance of each
topic from the corresponding one in the reference model. Similar to
\code{lmat}, but computed using only the top portion of the probability mass
for each topic, as specified by the \code{mass.threshol} parameter.
\code{NULL} if \code{mass.treshold==1}.} \item{L1mod}{A vector of length N
consisting of the row means of the \code{L1mat} matrix.}
\item{mass.threshold}{The mass threshold argument that was supplied to the
function.} \item{cov.effects}{A list of length N containing the output of
the run of \code{estimateEffect()} on each candidate model with the given
regression formula. \code{NULL} if no regression formula is given.}
\item{var.matrix}{A K-by-N matrix containing the estimated variance for each
of the fitted regression parameters. \code{NULL} if no regression formula is
given.} \item{confidence.ratings}{A vector of length N, where each entry
specifies the proportion of regression coefficient estimates in a candidate
model that fall within the .95 confidence interval for the corresponding
estimate in the reference model.} \item{align.global}{The alignment control
argument that was supplied to the function.} \item{reg.formula}{The
regression formula that was supplied to the function.} \item{reg.nsims}{The
\code{reg.nsims} argument that was supplied to the function.}
\item{reg.parameter.index}{The \code{reg.parameter.index} argument that was
supplied to the function.}

\description{
This function performs a suite of tests aimed at assessing the global
behavior of an STM model, which may have multiple modes. The function takes
in a collection of differently initialized STM fitted objects and selects a
reference model against which all others are benchmarked for stability. The
function returns an output of S3 class 'MultimodDiagnostic', with associated
plotting methods for quick inspection of the test results.
}
\details{
The purpose of this function is to automate and generalize the stability
analysis routines for topic models that are introduced in Roberts, Margaret
E., Brandon M. Stewart, and Dustin Tingley: "Navigating the Local Modes of
Big Data: The Case of Topic Models" (2014). For more detailed discussion
regarding the background and motivation for multimodality analysis, please
refer to the original article. See also the documentation for
\code{\link{plot.MultimodDiagnostic}} for help with the plotting methods
associated with this function.
