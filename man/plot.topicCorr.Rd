\title{Plot a topic correlation graph}
\usage{
\method{plot}{topicCorr}(
  x,
  topics = NULL,
  vlabels = NULL,
  layout = NULL,
  vertex.color = "green",
  vertex.label.cex = 0.75,
  vertex.label.color = "black",
  vertex.size = NULL,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A topicCorr model object.}

\item{topics}{A vector of topics to include in the plot, defaults to all.}

\item{vlabels}{A character vector of labels for the vertices.  Defaults to
"Topic #"}

\item{layout}{The layout algorithm passed to the \code{igraph} package.  It
will choose \code{layout.fruchterman.reingold} by default.  Note that to
pass an alternate algorithm you should load the \code{igraph} package first.}

\item{vertex.color}{Color of the vertices.}

\item{vertex.label.cex}{Controls the size of the labels.}

\item{vertex.label.color}{Controls the color of the labels.}

\item{vertex.size}{Controls the sizes of the vertices, either NULL, a scalar or a vector of the same length as number of topics.}

\item{\dots}{Additional parameters passed to \code{plot.graph.adjacency}}
}
\description{
Uses a topic correlation graph estimated by \code{\link{topicCorr}} and the
\code{igraph} package to plot a network where nodes are topics and edges
indicate a positive correlation.
}
\details{
Essentially a thin wrapper around the plotting functionality in the
\code{igraph} package. See package vignette for more details.

\examples{

\dontrun{

#This function becomes more useful with larger numbers of topics.
#it is demonstrated here with a small model simply to show how the syntax works.
cormat <- topicCorr(gadarianFit)
plot(cormat)
