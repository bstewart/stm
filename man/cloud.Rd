\title{Plot a wordcloud}
\usage{
cloud(
  stmobj,
  topic = NULL,
  type = c("model", "documents"),
  documents,
  thresh = 0.9,
  max.words = 100,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{stmobj}{The STM model object to be used in making the word cloud.}

\item{topic}{NULL to plot the marginal distribution of words in the corpus,
or a single integer indicating the topic number.}

\item{type}{Specifies how the wordcloud is constructed.  The type
\code{"model"} which is used by default is based on the probability of the
word given the topic.  The type \code{"documents"} plots words within
documents that have a topic proportion of higher than \code{thresh}.  This
requires that the \code{documents} argument also be specified.}

\item{documents}{The documents object of the same kind as passed to
\code{\link{stm}}.  This is only necessary if \code{type="documents"}.}

\item{thresh}{The threshold for including a document in the
\code{type="documents"} setting.}

\item{max.words}{The maximum number of words to be plotted.}

\item{...}{Additional parameters passed to \code{wordcloud}.}
}
\description{
Use the \pkg{wordcloud} package to plot a wordcloud for a particular topic
}
\details{
Uses the \pkg{wordcloud} package to make a word cloud of a particular topic.
The option \code{"model"} uses the topic-word model parameters.  Thus it
shows words weighted by their probability conditional that the word comes
from a particular topic.  With content covariates it averages over the
values for all levels of the content covariate weighted by the empirical
frequency in the dataset.  The option \code{"documents"} plots the words
which appear in documents that have a topic proportion higher than
\code{thresh}.  Thus \code{"model"} gives a pure model based interpretation
of the topic while \code{"documents"} gives a picture of all the words in
documents which are highly associated with the topic.
