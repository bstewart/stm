topicLasso(
  formula,
  data,
  stmobj = NULL,
  subset = NULL,
  omit.var = NULL,
  family = "gaussian",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula}{Formula specifying the dependent variable and additional
variables to included in the LASSO beyond the topics present in the stmobj.
Just pass a 1 on the right-hand side in order to run without additional
controls.}

\item{data}{Data file containing the dependent variable. Typically will be
the metadata file used in the stm analysis. It must have a number of rows
equal to the number of documents in the stmobj.}

\item{stmobj}{The STM object, and output from the \code{stm} function.}

\item{subset}{A logical statement that will be used to subset the corpus.}

\item{omit.var}{Pass a character vector of variable names to be excluded
from the plot.  Note this does not exclude them from the calculation, only
the plot.}

\item{family}{The family parameter used in \code{\link{glmnet}}.  See
explanation there.  Defaults to "gaussian"}

\item{main}{Character string for the main title.}

\item{xlab}{Character string giving an x-axis label.}

\item{labeltype}{Type of example words to use in labeling each topic. See
\code{\link{labelTopics}}. Defaults to "prob".}

\item{seed}{The random seed for replication of the cross-validation samples.}

\item{xlim}{Width of the x-axis.}

\item{standardize}{Whether to standardize variables. Default is FALSE, which
is different from the \pkg{glmnet} default because the topics are already
standardized.  Note that glmnet standardizes the variables by default but
then projects them back to their original scales before reporting
coefficients.}

\item{nfolds}{the number of cross-validation folds.  Defaults to 20.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to glmnet.  This can be useful
for addressing convergence problems.}

\description{
Use the \pkg{glmnet} package to plot LASSO based estimates of relationship
between an arbitrary dependent variable with topics and additional variables
as predictors.  This function is experimental (see below).
}
\details{
This function is used for estimating the most important topical predictors
of an arbitrary outcome.  The idea is to run an L1 regularized regression
using \code{\link{cv.glmnet}} in the \pkg{glmnet} package where the
document-level dependent variable is chosen by the user and the predictors
are the document-topic proportions in the \code{\link{stm}} model along with
any other variables of interest.

The function uses cross-validation to choose the regularization parameter
and generates a plot of which loadings were the most influential in
predicting the outcome.  It also invisibly returns the glmnet model so that
it can be used for prediction.

NOTE: This function is still very experimental and may have stability
issues.  If stability issues are encountered see the documentation in
\pkg{glmnet} for arguments that can be passed to improve convergence.  Also,
it is unlikely to work well with multivariate gaussian or multinomial
families.

#Load the poliblog data
data(poliblog5k)
#estimate a model with 50 topics
stm1 <- stm(poliblog5k.docs, poliblog5k.voc, 50,
            prevalence=~rating + blog, data=poliblog5k.meta,
            init.type="Spectral")
#make a plot of the topics most predictive of "rating"
out <- topicLasso(rating ~ 1, family="binomial", data=poliblog5k.meta,stmobj=stm1)
#generate some in-sample predictions
pred <- predict(out, newx=stm1$theta,type="class")
#check the accuracy of the predictions
table(pred, poliblog5k.meta$rating)
