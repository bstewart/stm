Variational EM for the Structural Topic Model
}
\description{
Estimation of the Structural Topic Model using semi-collapsed variational EM.  The function takes sparse representation of a document-term matrix, an integer number of topics, and covariates and returns fitted model parameters.  Covariates can be used in the prior for topic \code{prevalence}, in the prior for topical \code{content} or both.  See an overview of functions in the package here: \code{\link{stm-package}}

stm(documents, vocab, K, 
    prevalence, content, data=NULL,
    init.type=c("LDA", "Random", "Spectral"), seed=NULL,

}
\arguments{
   \item{documents}{
  The documents to be modeled if supplied as a list, or a \pkg{quanteda} \link[quanteda]{dfm} (document-feature matrix) object.  If a list, then \code{documents} must be a list of with each element corresponding to a document.  Each document is represented as an integer matrix with two rows, and columns equal to the number of unique vocabulary words in the document.  The first row contains the 1-indexed vocabulary entry and the second row contains the number of times that term appears.
 
  This is similar to the format in the \code{\link[lda]{lda}} package except that (following R convention) the vocabulary is indexed from one. Corpora can be imported using the reader function and manipulated using the \code{\link{prepDocuments}}.  Raw texts can be ingested using \code{\link{textProcessor}}.
  }
  \item{vocab}{
  Character vector specifying the words in the corpus in the order of the vocab indices in documents. Each term in the vocabulary index must appear at least once in the documents.  See \code{\link{prepDocuments}} for dropping unused items in the vocabulary.   If \code{documents} is a \pkg{quanteda} \link[quanteda]{dfm} object, then \code{vocab} is should not (and must not) also be supplied.
}
  \item{K}{
  Typically a positive integer (of size 2 or greater) representing the desired number of topics. If \code{init.type="Spectral"} you can also set \code{K=0} to use the algorithm of Lee and Mimno (2014) to set the number of topics (although unlike the standard spectral initialization this is not deterministic).  Additional detail on choosing the number of topics below.
}
  \item{prevalence}{
  A formula object with no response variable or a matrix containing topic prevalence covariates.  Use \code{\link{s}}, \code{\link[splines]{ns}} or \code{\link[splines]{bs}} to specify smooth terms. See details for more information.
}
  \item{content}{
  A formula containing a single variable, a factor variable or something which can be coerced to a factor indicating the category of the content variable for each document.
}
  \item{data}{
an optional data frame containing the prevalence and/or content covariates.  If unspecified the variables are taken from the active environment.}
  \item{init.type}{
The method of initialization.  Must be either Latent Dirichlet Allocation ("LDA"), "Random" or "Spectral".  See details for more info. If you want to replicate a previous result, see the argument \code{seed}.  
}
  \item{seed}{
Seed for the random number generator. \code{stm} saves the seed it uses on every run so that any result can be exactly reproduced.  When attempting to reproduce a result with that seed, it should be specified here.
}
  \item{max.em.its}{
  The maximum number of EM iterations.  If convergence has not been met at this point, a message will be printed.
}
  \item{emtol}{
Convergence tolerance.  EM stops when the relative change in the approximate bound drops below this level.  Defaults to .00001.
}
  \item{verbose}{
  A logical flag indicating whether information should be printed to the screen.  During the E-step (iteration over documents) a dot will print each time 1\% of the documents are completed.  At the end of each iteration the approximate bound will also be printed.
}
  \item{reportevery}{
  An integer determining the intervals at which labels are printed to the screen during fitting.  Defaults to every 5 iterations.
}
 \item{LDAbeta}{
 a logical that defaults to \code{TRUE} when there are no content covariates.  When set to \code{FALSE} the model performs SAGE style topic updates (sparse deviations from a baseline).
 }
 \item{interactions}{
 a logical that defaults to \code{TRUE}.  This automatically includes interactions between content covariates and the latent topics.  Setting it to \code{FALSE} reduces to a model with no interactive effects.
 }
  \item{ngroups}{
 Number of groups for memoized inference.  See details below.
 }
   \item{model}{
 A prefit model object.  By passing an \code{stm} object to this argument you can restart an existing model.  See details for more info.
 }
 \item{gamma.prior}{
 sets the prior estimation method for the prevalence covariate model.  The default \code{Pooled} options uses Normal prior distributions with a topic-level pooled variance which is given a moderately regularizing half-cauchy(1,1) prior.  The alternative \code{L1} uses \code{glmnet} to estimate a grouped penalty between L1-L2.  See details below.
 }
 \item{sigma.prior}{
 a scalar between 0 and 1 which defaults to 0.  This sets the strength of regularization towards a diagonalized covariance matrix.  Setting the value above 0 can be useful if topics are becoming too highly correlated.
 }
 \item{kappa.prior}{
 sets the prior estimation for the content covariate coefficients.  The default option is the \code{L1} prior.  The second option is \code{Jeffreys} which is markedly less computationally efficient but is included for backwards compatability. See details for more information on computation.
 }
 \item{control}{
 a list of additional parameters control portions of the optimization.  See details.
 }
}
\details{
This is the main function for estimating a Structural Topic Model (STM).  STM is an admixture with covariates in both mixture components.  Users provide a corpus of documents and a number of topics.  Each word in a document comes from exactly one topic and each document is represented by the proportion of its words that come from each of the K topics.  These proportions are found in the N (number of documents) by K (user specified number of topics) theta matrix.  Each of the K topics are represented as distributions over words.  The K-by-V (number of words in the vocabulary) matrix logbeta contains the natural log of the probability of seeing each word conditional on the topic.

The most important user input in parametric topic models is the number of topics.  There is no right answer to the appropriate number of topics.  More topics will give more fine-grained representations of the data at the potential cost of being less precisely estimated.  The number must be at least 2 which is equivalent to a unidimensional scaling model.  For short corpora focused on very specific subject matter (such as survey experiments) 3-10 topics is a useful starting range.  For small corpora (a few hundred to a few thousand) 5-50 topics is a good place to start.  Beyond these rough guidelines it is application specific.  Previous applications in political science with medium sized corpora (10k to 100k documents) have found 60-100 topics to work well.  For larger corpora 100 topics is a useful default size.  Of course, your mileage may vary.

When \code{init.type="Spectral"} and \code{K=0} the number of topics is set using the algorithm in Lee and Mimno (2014).  See vignette for details.  We emphasize here as we do there that this does not estimate the "true" number of topics and does not necessarily have any particular statistical properties for consistently estimating the number of topics.  It can however provide a useful starting point.

The model for topical prevalence includes covariates which the analyst believes may influence the frequency with which a topic is discussed.  This is specified as a formula which can contain smooth terms using splines or by using the function \code{\link{s}}.  The response portion of the formula should be left blank.  See the examples.  These variables can include numeric and factor variables.  While including variables of class \code{Dates} or other non-numeric, non-factor types will work in \code{stm} it may not always work for downstream functions such as \code{\link{estimateEffect}}.

The topical convent covariates are those which affect the way in which a topic is discussed. As currently implemented this must be a single variable which defines a discrete partition of the dataset (each document is in one and only one group).  We may relax this in the future.  While including more covariates in topical prevalence will rarely affect the speed of the model, including additional levels of the content covariates can make the model much slower to converge.  This is due to the model operating in the much higher dimensional space of words in dictionary (which tend to be in the thousands) as opposed to topics.  

In addition to the default priors for prevalence, we also make use of the \code{glmnet} package to allow for penalties between the L1 and L2 norm.  In these settings we estimate a regularization path and then select the optimal shrinkage parameter using a user-tuneable information criterion.  By default selecting the \code{L1} option will apply the L1 penalty selecting the optimal shrinkage parameter using AIC. The defaults have been specifically tuned for the STM but almost all the relevant arguments can be changed through the control structure below.  Changing the \code{gamma.enet} parameters allow the user to choose a mix between the L1 and L2 norms.  When set to 1 (as by default) this is the lasso penalty, when set to 0 its the ridge penalty.  Any value in between is a mixture called the elastic net.

The default prior choice for content covariates is now the \code{L1} option.  This uses an approximation framework developed in Taddy (2013) called Distributed Multinomial Regression which utilizes a factorized poisson approximation to the multinomial.  See Roberts, Stewart and Airoldi (2014) for details on the implementation here.  This is dramatically faster than previous versions.  The old default setting which uses a Jeffreys prior is also available.  

The argument \code{init.type} allows the user to specify an intialization method.  The default uses collapsed gibbs sampling for the LDA model.  The choice \code{"Spectral"} provides a deterministic inialization using the spectral algorithm given in Arora et al 2013.  See Roberts, Stewart and Tingley (2014) for details and a comparison of different approaches.  Particularly when the number of documents is relatively large we highly recommend the Spectral algorithm which often performs extremely well.  Note that the random seed plays no role in the spectral initialization as it is completely deterministic (unless using the \code{K=0} or random projection settings).

Specifying an integer greater than 1 for the argument \code{ngroups} causes the corpus to be broken into the specified number of groups.  Global updates are then computed after each group in turn.  This approach, called memoized variational inference in Hughes and Sudderth (2013), can lead to more rapid convergence when the number of documents is large.  Note that the memory requirements scale linearly with the number of groups so this provides a tradeoff between memory efficiency and computational power.

Models can now be restarted by passing an \code{STM} object to the argument \code{model}.  This is particularly useful if you run a model to the maximum iterations and it terminates without converging.  Note that all the standard arguments still need to be passed to the object (including any formulas, the number of topics, etc.).  Be sure to change the \code{max.em.its} argument or it will simply complete one additional iteration and stop.  

The \code{control} argument is a list with named components which can be used to specify numerous additional computational details.  Valid components include:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{tau.maxit}}{Controls the maximum number of iterations when estimating the prior for content covariates.  When the mode is \code{Jeffreys}, estimation proceeds by iterating between the kappa vector corresponding to a particular topic and the associated variance tau before moving on to the next parameter vector. this controls the maximum number of iterations. It defaults to \code{NULL} effectively enforcing convergence.  When the mode is \code{L1} this sets the maximum number of passes in the coordinate descent algorithm and defaults to 1e8.}
    \item{\code{tau.tol}}{Sets the convergence tolerance in the optimization for content covariates.  When the mode is \code{Jeffreys} this sets the convergence tolerance in the iteration between the kappa vector and variances tau and defaults to 1e-5.  With \code{L1} it defaults to 1e-6.}
    \item{\code{kappa.mstepmaxit}}{When the mode for content covariate estimation is \code{Jeffreys} this controls the maximum number of passes through the sequence of kappa vectors.  It defaults to 3.  It has no role under \code{L1}- see \code{tau.maxit} option instead.}
    \item{\code{kappa.msteptol}}{WHen the mode for content covariate estimation is \code{Jeffreys} this controls the tolerance for convergence (measured by the L1 norm) for the entire M-step.  It is set to .01 by default.  This has no role under mode \code{L1}- see \code{tau.tol} option instead.}
    \item{\code{fixedintercept}}{a logical indicating whether in content covariate models the intercept should be fixed to the background distribution.  TRUE by default. This only applies when kappa.prior is set to L1.  If FALSE the intercept is estimated from the data without penalty.  In practice estimated intercepts often push term probabilities to zero, resulting in topics that look more like those in a Dirichlet model- that is, most terms have approximately zero probability with some terms with high probability.}
    \item{\code{kappa.enet}}{When using the L1 mode for content covariates this controls the elastic net mixing parameter.  See the argument \code{alpha} in \code{glmnet}.  Value must be between 1 and 0 where 1 is the lasso penalty (the default) and 0 is the ridge penalty.  The closer the parameter is to zero the less sparse the solution will tend to be.}
    \item{\code{gamma.enet}}{Controls the elastic net mixing parameter for the prevalence covariates.  See above for a description.}
    \item{\code{nlambda}}{Controls the length of the regularization path when using L1 mode for content covariates.  Defaults to 500.  Note that glmnet relies heavily on warm starts and so a high number will often (counter-intuitively) be less costly than a low number.  We have chosen a higher default here than the default in the glmnet package and we don't recommend changing it.}
    \item{\code{lambda.min.ratio}}{For L1 mode content covariates this controls the explored path of regularization values.  This defaults to .0001.  Setting higher numbers will result in more sparse solutions.  This is here primarily for dealing with convergence issues, if you want to favor selection of sparser solutions see the next argument.}
    \item{\code{ic.k}}{For L1 mode content covariates this controls the selection of the regularization parameter.  We use a generic information criterion which penalizes complexity by the parameter \code{ic.k}.  When set to 2 (as by default) this results in AIC.  When set to log(n) (where n is the total number of words in the corpus) this is equivalent to BIC.  Larger numbers will express a preference for sparser (simpler) models.}
    \item{\code{nits}}{Sets the number of iterations for collapsed gibbs sampling in LDA initializations.  Defaults to 50}
    \item{\code{burnin}}{Sets the burnin for collapsed gibbs sampling in LDA intializations. Defaults to 25}
    \item{\code{alpha}}{Sets the prevalence hyperparameter in collapsed gibbs sampling in LDA initializations.  Defaults to 50/K}
    \item{\code{eta}}{Sets the topic-word hyperparameter in collapsed gibbs sampling in LDa intializations.  Defaults to .01}
    \item{\code{contrast}}{A logical indicating whether a standard contrast coding should be used for content covariates.  Typically this should remain at the default of FALSE.}
    \item{\code{rp.s}}{Parameter between 0 and 1 controlling the sparsity of random projections for the spectral initailization.  Defaults to .05}
    \item{\code{rp.p}}{Dimensionality of the random projections for the spectral initialization.  Defaults to 3000.}
    \item{\code{rp.d.group.size}}{Controls the size of blocks considered at a time when computing the random projections for the spectral initialization.  Defaults to 2000.}
    \item{\code{SpectralRP}}{A logical which when \code{TRUE} turns on the experimental random projections spectral initialization.}
